PRD – Snapchat Application
Overview
Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app primarily used for sharing photos and videos with friends. The app allows users to send "Snaps" that disappear after being viewed, as well as share stories that last for 24 hours. Snapchat also includes features such as filters, lenses, chat, voice/video calling, and Discover, which allows users to explore content from publishers and creators. The app focuses on a unique user experience with a combination of ephemeral content, real-time interaction, and augmented reality (AR) features.
