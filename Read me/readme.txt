Architecture

Server versions refer to different editions of server software released by companies like Microsoft (for Windows Server), Red Hat (for Linux), or other providers. Each version typically offers varying levels of features, performance, and support for enterprise needs.

For example, Windows Server has various versions such as:

Windows Server 2022

Windows Server 2019

Windows Server 2016

Windows Server 2012 R2, etc.

Each version comes with updates in security, scalability, and virtualization capabilities, among other features. Linux servers, on the other hand, may have distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Ubuntu Server, or CentOS in different versions.

Server roles refer to the primary functions or services that a server provides in a network. Common server roles include:

Domain Controller (Active Directory) – Manages user accounts, groups, and network security policies.

Web Server (IIS/Apache/Nginx) – Hosts websites or web applications.

File Server– Manages and stores shared files and directories for network users.

Database Server (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL) – Hosts and manages databases.

Print Server – Manages and controls printers on a network.

DNS Server – Resolves domain names to IP addresses for network devices.

DHCP Server – Assigns IP addresses to devices in a network dynamically.

Mail Server (Exchange Server/Postfix) – Handles sending, receiving, and managing emails.

Hyper-V/VMware ESXi (Virtualization) – Provides infrastructure for running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical hardware.

Server roles are essential for defining the specific function a server will perform within a network infrastructure, allowing businesses to tailor their server environment to their unique needs.

Access

Access to server versions and roles typically depends on the type of server software being used and the roles configured within the network. Here’s how access might work for each:

Server Versions:
Licensing: Access to server versions requires valid licensing from the vendor (e.g., Microsoft for Windows Server, Red Hat for RHEL). Admins need to install the licensed version of the server operating system.

User Access: Once the server is set up, users access its services or resources based on the roles assigned to the server. For example, access to a database server would be via database management tools (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio for Windows SQL Server).

Server Roles:
Access to server roles can be configured through different levels of permissions, depending on the role: Domain Controller (Active Directory): Admins or users with sufficient privileges can access AD services to manage user accounts, groups, and network policies. Permissions are defined within AD groups (e.g., Domain Admins).

Web Server: Access can be managed through firewalls, and user permissions may be granted to website or application owners (e.g., FTP or remote access for developers).

File Server: Access is managed through file permissions (e.g., Read/Write, Modify) which can be controlled at the folder or file level using NTFS permissions in Windows or chmod in Linux.

Database Server: Access is managed through database-level roles and privileges (e.g., DBA roles, read/write permissions to databases). Authentication can be via Active Directory or local database users.

DNS/DHCP Server: Admin access is required to manage these roles. Network administrators configure IP addresses or domain names. End-users typically access these services automatically without knowing it.

Print Server: Users are given permissions to use shared printers, often through group policies or manual permissions.

Mail Server: Access to email services is typically via email clients (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird), with authentication being done via email accounts managed by the server admin. Hyper-V/Virtualization: Admins need access to manage virtual machines through tools like Hyper-V Manager, VMware vSphere, etc. Permissions can be assigned based on the user's role in the network. Hardware and Platform Requirements

Hardware Requirements:

 Responsiveness: The game should work on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

 Scalability: Support a large number of concurrent players and games.

 Offline Support: Handle brief internet disconnects for players without losing game progress.

 Security: Secure user data and game states, with proper authentication and encryption.

 Performance: Ensure low latency for real-time game updates and fast leaderboard refreshes.

Technical Requirements:

Frontend: React, WebSockets for real-time updates.

Backend: Node.js, Express, REST APIs, WebSocket server.

Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for caching game states

System Connectivity

Frontend (Player's Browser) → Backend (Game Server)

WebSockets: For real-time gameplay updates (player moves, scores, game status).

HTTP/REST API: For game creation, joining, leaderboard retrieval, and authentication.

Backend (Game Server) → Database

SQL Queries: To store and retrieve game states, player profiles, leaderboard information, and word dictionaries.
Backend → Cache (Redis)

Caching: Use Redis to temporarily store active game sessions and real-time game data for faster access and performance optimization.
4.Super Admin Interface → Backend

HTTP/REST API: Admins use the API to manage game boards, word dictionaries, and introduce new game types.
Authentication Service → Backend

OAuth/JWT: For secure player login, registration, and session management across different games and devices.
This system ensures smooth communication between players, backend services, and data storage, supporting real-time updates and scalability. Standards

4.1Security Standards

  Authentication & Authorization: 
OAuth 2.0 / JWT: Use OAuth for secure login (e.g., Google, Facebook) and JWT tokens for session management, ensuring users are authenticated and authorized.

 Data Encryption:

HTTPS (SSL/TLS): Encrypt all data exchanged between the client and server to protect against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

Password Encryption: Hash and salt passwords using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) before storing them in the database.

 Access Control:

Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure that only authorized users (e.g., admins) can access sensitive features like game board and dictionary management.

Least Privilege: Grant users the minimum level of access needed to perform their tasks.

 Input Validation & Sanitization:

Sanitize Input: Validate all user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

CSRF Protection: Implement anti-CSRF tokens for secure form submissions.

 Data Privacy:

GDPR Compliance: Ensure user data is stored and processed in line with privacy regulations, allowing users to control their data.

 Logging & Monitoring:

Audit Logs: Track and monitor access to sensitive features and actions, especially by super admins.

Intrusion Detection: Implement monitoring for suspicious activities like brute force attacks or unauthorized access attempts. Support

Technical Support:

Bug Reporting: Implement an easy-to-access bug reporting feature for players to submit issues directly from the game.

Real-Time Monitoring: Use monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) to track server performance and respond to outages or slowdowns quickly.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Define response times for different issue severity levels (e.g., critical errors, minor bugs).
