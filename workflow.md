To build this online multiplayer Scrabble-like game with leaderboard capabilities using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), let's break down a possible workflow that will cover the main aspects of the game from the PRD.

### MERN Stack Workflow

#### 1. **Set up the Project Structure**

   - **Backend**: Use Node.js and Express to handle API endpoints, game logic, and manage real-time interactions (e.g., through WebSockets or similar).
   - **Frontend**: Use React for a dynamic, responsive user interface where players can interact with the game in real time.
   - **Database**: Use MongoDB to store user data, game state, leaderboard information, etc.

---

#### 2. **Database Design (MongoDB)**

   - **Players Collection**: Store player data such as `playerId`, `username`, `email`, `friends`, and `leaderboardPosition`.
   - **Games Collection**: Store game details, including `gameId`, `gameState` (board state), `players`, `turn`, `isActive`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
   - **Leaderboard Collection**: Track high scores, number of wins, and other relevant statistics for players.
   - **Dictionaries Collection**: Manage word dictionaries and any metadata required for specific game boards (managed by Super Admin).

#### 3. **Backend (Node.js & Express)**

   - **Authentication**: Implement user login and registration with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
   - **API Endpoints**:
     - **Game Management**:
       - `POST /games/create`: Create a new game (any player can start a game).
       - `POST /games/invite`: Invite friends to join a game (send game link or unique code).
       - `GET /games/:id`: Fetch game details, including current board state and players.
       - `POST /games/:id/move`: Submit a move (with word validation and scoring).
       - `POST /games/:id/end`: End game and update leaderboard.
     - **Leaderboard**:
       - `GET /leaderboard`: Retrieve current leaderboard.
       - `GET /leaderboard/:playerId`: Fetch a specific player's ranking.
     - **Admin Controls**:
       - `POST /admin/dictionary`: Add or update dictionaries (for Super Admin).
       - `POST /admin/boards`: Add new game boards or configurations.
   - **WebSocket** for real-time updates to handle player moves, update the board for all players, manage turn-taking, and sync game state if a player reconnects.

#### 4. **Frontend (React)**

   - **UI Components**:
     - **Game Board**: A responsive component that displays the Scrabble board, letter tiles, and players’ names.
     - **Player List**: Shows the list of current players in the game.
     - **Leaderboard**: Displays players ranked by score, with highlights for friends or the current player.
     - **Move Submission Form**: Allows players to input a word and submit it as their move.
     - **Notifications**: Real-time updates for actions like "player joined", "word accepted/rejected", or "player’s turn".
     - **Game Creation & Invitation**: Interface to create a game and invite friends.
     - **Admin Dashboard**: For Super Admins to add/update boards, dictionaries, or other configurations.
   - **Game Flow**:
     - **Home Screen**: Options to start a new game, join an existing game, or view the leaderboard.
     - **Game Screen**: Interactive game board with real-time updates, player tiles, and a move log.
     - **Leaderboard Screen**: Lists current leaderboard, with search functionality to find specific players.

   - **State Management**: Use `Redux` or `Context API` to manage global state, especially for game states and leaderboard data.

#### 5. **Real-time Game Mechanics (WebSockets)**

   - Use **Socket.io** or a similar WebSocket library to enable real-time gameplay.
     - **Join Room**: When a game is created, each player joining will connect to a unique game room.
     - **Real-Time Updates**: Emit events for game actions such as tile placement, turn changes, or word validation. Sync game state for all players to ensure consistency.
     - **Reconnect Logic**: Allow players who disconnect to rejoin their game and restore their last known game state.

---

#### 6. **Leaderboards and Scoring Logic**

   - **Leaderboard Update**: On game completion, update the leaderboard with the game results, including player rankings and scores.
   - **Scoring Algorithm**: Implement the Scrabble scoring logic (assign points for each letter, bonus for premium tiles, etc.), and ensure real-time updates to reflect players' scores.
   - **Personalized Ranking**: Allow players to see their position on the leaderboard, either globally or within their friend group.

---

#### 7. **Offline Capability**

   - Use **Service Workers** and **IndexedDB** (or local storage) for basic offline functionality:
     - Cache game data to allow players to view the current game state even if the connection is temporarily lost.
     - Sync moves and updates once the connection is restored.

---

#### 8. **Extensibility for New Game Types**

   - Use a modular approach where each game board or game type is stored separately in the database with specific configurations.
   - Use the Admin Dashboard to allow new game types or boards to be added, with minimal backend code changes.

---

#### 9. **Metrics Tracking**

   - Collect metrics for `Number of players`, `Number of games played`, and other engagement-related events.
   - Use a service like **Google Analytics** or **Mixpanel** to track user actions and game completion rates.
   - Store custom metrics (like move frequencies) in MongoDB for analysis.
